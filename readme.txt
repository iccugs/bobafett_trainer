Here is a newer version of the mini version of the BoBaFeTT trainer in source code
format that works with Diablo 1.08.

I've decided to release the source code to the mini version of the BoBaFeTT trainer.
This has been written to work with Diablo version 1.05 or 1.07.  If you'd like
to change it around and even make it work for another game, you're welcome to it.
I don't play Diablo any more so you can use this Visual C++ 6.0 source code any
way you want to.  You can even publish it and make money off of it if you want.
You can put it on a CD-ROM and distribute it all the way to Afganistan.  You can
remove my name from the source and say you wrote it.  You can try to copyright
it, but I doubt you'd get very far because it's now in the public domain as of
today.  No royalties are incurred from any sale of this software is necessary.
Just say thanks to me when you see me sometimes on battle.net.  I won't be
with the Diablo icon on there.  You'll see me on there with the Brood War icon.

Good luck in your future Visual C++ programming!
